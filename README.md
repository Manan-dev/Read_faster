## Why I created this?

 I created this little project as sort of an experiment. I wanted to find out if bolding few characters of the word can actually help you read faster. I have tried it on my friends and they felt like they were reading so much faster.

## Why this works?

  Our eyes can scan the first bold letters and our brain can sort of autocomplete the words. This technique lets us read faster, is less overwhelming and helps us stay focused.
